# Scrolling-1
Swift 3/Xcode 8.2 /iOS 10

Just want to share some of my experiences with scrolling, zooming and paging, you can also take it as a guide/help and tutorial 
in case you'd like to learn how this works and how to build this on your own. I will permanently continue to share code and 
examples here.
